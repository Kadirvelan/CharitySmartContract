This can easily result\r in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an\r error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.\r `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an\r operation overflows.\r  * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire\r class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.\r",
